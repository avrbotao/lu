	Readme

This is the `README' file for lu

	What is it ?

lu (level usage) is an utility to show disk space used on a per-depth basis

	Tarball

it is distributed in a tar-gzipped archive, and to open it, simply :

$ gzip -d lu-<version>.tar.gz
$ tar xf lu-<version>.tar

	Source-code directory

After the steps above, go to the source-code directory, 

$ cd lu-<version>

	Installation

Building could hardly be simpler; just unpack it, and in the source directory :

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

- and you're done, gnu-style.

	Validation

Optionally, you can

$ make test

right after `make' (or at any later time),
just to validate some key features and functions.

	Concepts

if  you are not unix/Linux tech support staff, just get familiar to the concepts of directory, filesystem and disk usage prior to usinf 'lu'.

	Reports

the typical output is a list of directories and sizes.

	Development

this is an ongoing project,
so the 'TODO' file has quite a few tasks, plans, ideas
still to be implemented in due time.

	Warnings

this software requires root privileges (1) if you are not the owner of the directories being inspected.

	Feedback

Bug reports should be directed to either github or the `support' facility at SourceForge;
However, any comment, improvement/enhencement suggestions, problem report,
or general feedback can be sent by email and is very welcome.

In the case of bug/problem report, please include specific details about
the operating system, compiler, processor architecture, and version number.

	Notes

(1) Using ANY software with `root' privileges requires appropriate knowledge.
